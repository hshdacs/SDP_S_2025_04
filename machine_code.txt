register file: r0 .. r15
RISC (reduced instruction set computer)
instructions:

loop:
	mov r0, r2		; r2 = r0 (transfer the content of r0 into r2)
	add r1, r2		; r2 = r2 + r1
	bz  exit		; the result of the previous operation is evaluated
	inc r1			; shortcut for r1 = r1 + 1 (r1++)
	jmp loop		; unconditional jump to that location
exit:
	rts
